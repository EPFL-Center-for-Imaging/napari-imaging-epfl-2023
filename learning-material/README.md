# Image data visualization with Python and Napari

![segmentation](images/segmentation_fig.png)

[Napari](https://www.napari.org/) is a multi-dimensional image viewer for Python. It is used to visualize scientific images and the data associated with them, such as segmentation masks, bounding boxes, and keypoints, for example. With Napari, you can

- visualize timeseries, 2D, 3D, and multi-channel images.
- create interactive visualizations tailored to your needs.
- set up visualizations in a Python script or a [Jupyter notebook](https://jupyter.org/).
- annotate data (draw masks, polygons, etc.).
- use [plugins from the community](https://www.napari-hub.org/) or develop and share your own plugin.
