    "This notebook will give you a practical introduction to the Napari viewer. Napari is a general-purpose N-dimensional image viewer based on Python. It is designed for browsing, annotating, and analyzing large multi-dimensional images. By integrating closely with Python, napari can be easily coupled to machine learning and image analysis libraries (e.g. `scikit-image`, `scikit-learn`, `TensorFlow`, `PyTorch`) enabling a user-friendly and automated analysis.\n",
